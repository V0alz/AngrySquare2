### Angry Square 2
Angry Square 2 is a 2D game made using OpenGL(3.3), based on an older probject using DirectX9.  (The last version released was built on 19 December 2012 @ 22:00:22)  
I plan to expand on my original idea...

Any textures may not be final.
I'm not investing huge amounts of time into this project, so updates here may be small.

#### Building
The source will require a few libs to compile...  
GLFW(>~ 3.*)  
GLEW(>= 1.13.0)  
GLM  
FreeType(>~ 2.6.*)  

#### License
See the LICENSE(.md) file for more details.
